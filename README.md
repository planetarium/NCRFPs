# Nine Chronicles Request For Proposal (NCRFPs)

[Nine Chronicles](http://nine-chronicles.com) is a **fully open-sourced** **online RPG without servers** — like Bitcoin or BitTorrent, the gamers and miners connect to each other to power a distributed game network. Set in a vast fantasy world, it is governed by [its players](http://discord.gg/planetarium), and supported by a complex economy where supply and demand are the greatest currency.

We believe decentralized infrastructure has created new possibilities for online gaming, where communities can become the actual owners of an online world. We are proud to say that we kept our promise from the very beginning by **fully open sourcing our repositories for Nine Chronicles**! Now players and developers alike can use any part of the game, from the beautiful bespoke 2D assets to in-game logic and code.

We are offering grants to developers and modders who can build tools and content for the Nine Chronicles ecosystem. Building something from our wishlist will greatly help the community; however, we are also interested in hearing from people who have cool ideas not featured on our wishlist. There is still a chance we can help fund the idea.

The grants we provide may not cover 100% of the development costs. We will do our best to fairly compensate all community efforts with a mixture of fiat, NCG, and special in-game items.

There are 2 ways that Planetarium can help fund teams:

- Teams may be rewarded retroactively for their efforts and without the need for an application. This will be purely based on historical results and community impact.
- Teams actively apply via this program in order to get paid as they work, on a milestone-by-milestone basis.

# Grant Offer

We award grants for incentivize team to develop the Nine Chronicles ecosystem. We offer a mixture of NCG and fiat currency depending on the project’s needs.

# Criteria

The following is our list of criteria for assessing teams to fund. 

- Ideal length: 3 months.
    - Best to structure the work as 1 month = 1 milestone.
- Open source license preferred
    - e.g. Apache 2, MIT, GPLv3.
- Teams shouldn’t look to cover all of their development costs with a grant.
- Teams should indicate why they are interested in supporting the Nine Chronicles Ecosystem and indicate why their team is a good fit.
