# Proposal
- Develop and provide a browser version of Nine Chronicles for players to enjoy the game directly from a web browser.

# Motivation
- Bridging the gap between PC and mobile devices. Provide support for players in network-restricted environments to be able to enjoy Nine Chronicles.
- The relatively high difficulty of modding the Unity client. There is a need for a game client that is easier to modify.
- A lightweight client that allows for easy gameplay or quick consumption of action points or tickets when desired.

# Impact
- Secure a platform for lightweight gameplay without installation and increase opportunities for client modding.
- Although the Nine Chronicles team made the design proposal, this proposal will open the gateway for community development teams to develop directly instead of the Nine Chronicles team, providing opportunities for community participation and modding.
